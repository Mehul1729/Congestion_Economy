# Congestion Economy
This project tries to analyse and build upon the problem of congestion faced on Indian roads.



# Steps to Load Data  
1. We are using google maps API to fetch traffic data of a particular Region's main road networks.
2. The fetched data is stored in a csv with all the paths and road networks with their congestion level.
3. Mutiple fetches of the live traffic is performed at different time to get a temporal state of traffic situation.
4. Congestion level is caluted based on time it would take on average to travel on that path vs the time it would taks in the current traffic situations.
5. This data is then visualized on Tableu.

### This work is currently in progress and is updated on regular basis.

# Goal 
The goal of this study is to know the current indian roads network situation and where the network should be improved for more efficient traffic management and to reduce traffic incidents.
